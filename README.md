# Tarot
Hi guys! First project I'm putting on github, just a cute little app I made for my girlfriend. You click the button and it gives you a tarot card! Best way to run this is to run it locally on an angular server, all browser based. I'll see if I can add some more details as to how to get it running on your local machine, sorry I'm new *shrug*. Thanks for forking or whatever lol.
